      Hi there, I'm a NYC-based software engineer focusing on JavaScript, with a background of building scaleable <span className='boldText'>react/redux/node </span>applications. Most recently I co-created an electron tool for devs to see their micro-service communication, for the open-source community.

      Prior to becoming an engineer I was a designer for over 10 years. During my tenure, I started doing UI work ont he job (at the time jQuery was the popular library). Over the years, I my passion for engineering outgrew my passion for design and I realized I wanted to make a pivot.

        Seeking out my next challenge, I enrolled in an immersive software engineering residency in NYC. It was equally the most challenging and rewarding thing I've ever done. I met great people, that I still keep in contact with daily, and learned how to "navigate the unknown" and to not be afraid to get my hands dirty, learning a new technology.

        Outside of work, I enjoy teaching my daughter how to play basketball, cooking, watching sci-fi movies/shows and reading new articles on blogs like medium and sitepoint, etc.
